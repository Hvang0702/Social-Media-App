# Social-Media-App

## Description
This repository contains my front-end and back-end code for my Social Media App (Postology).
I created this project for fun and wanted to utilize both front-end components and back-end api calls and databases.

## Features
* User Authentication: Sign up, log in, and securely authenticate your users.
* Posts and Feeds: Upload posts, images, and updates with your followers. Scroll through your personalized feed to see posts from friends.
* Likes and Comments: Interact with posts by liking and commenting on them.
* Responsive Design: A seamless experience across devices.

## Technologies Used
 FrontEnd:
* React Js: React Js was used for the front end for the user to visualize different components such as the navbar, adding friends, like posts, dark mode, and commenting on people's posts. Has a responsive layout for both pc and mobile users.

BackEnd:
* Built on Node.js and Express, providing a robust and scalable server.
* Database: MongoDB is used as the database to store user profiles, posts, and other relevant data.
